# House Price Prediction

This project implements machine learning models for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Overview

The code includes:
- Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Neural Network model using TensorFlow/Keras

## Dataset

For demonstration purposes, the California Housing Dataset is used. You can replace it with your own dataset.
